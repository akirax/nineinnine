# Nine in Nine

__Nine in Nine__ is a [micro-site](http://www.nineinnine.com) built for a [friend](https://www.instagram.com/howe_wonderful/) who wanted to raise money advocating sports for kids. The site explains the charities and sponsors involved along with an explanation of why he decided to run nine marathons :runner: in nine days hence "Nine in Nine".

In able to make it mobile-first, the usage of SVGs and static HTML became paramount.
